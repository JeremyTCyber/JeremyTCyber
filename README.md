Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on getting my master's degree in IT
- 🌱 I’m currently learning White Hat systems testing, Virtualization, Enterprise Archetecture, Enterprise Security, AWS, Azure AD (Entra), and more. 
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was never going to go to school for anything other than music, little did I know that I would have and engineering degree and I never thought I would get my master's degree. It's funny how our younger selves make absolute statements not knowing how much we will change as we get older.
